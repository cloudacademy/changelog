## Release Notes: v7.6 (Apr 10, 2018)

### New Features:

- We're pleased to announce that Training Plans are now generally available to customers on our Enterprise plan. To learn more, visit cloudacademy.com/product/training-plans

## Release Notes: v7.5 (Apr 6, 2018)

### New Features:

- Improvements to the courses UI: we tweaked, iterated, and obsessed over the user interface of the video player and the user experience navigating video lectures.

- New page for our partner program: we released a section on the website for current and prospective partners, which you can learn more about at https://cloudacademy.com/partners/

- Enterprise Reports: these are now downloadable directly from the Cloud Academy platform. Previously, we emailed you when they were ready (and we agree, that was annoying).

- We pressed on with finishing touches to features we're about to launch which are, well, really quite momentous. Stay tuned because April is going to be good...

### Bug Fixes:

- Versioning now works much better when Cloud Academy makes changes to Learning Paths.



## Release Notes: v7.2 (Mar 16, 2018)

### New Features:
- Retake quizzes and exams in a Learning Path: we have reintroduced the button to retake quizzes and exams within Learning       Paths.

- Change due date on Training Plan Cycles: it is possible for Team Managers to change the due date of a Training Plan Cycle     through the UI of the Training Plan Cycle's   detail page.
  
- Aggregate Training Plan Cycle Progress for Managers / Admins: Training Plan managers previously received as many emails as     the number of Training Plans they'd manage. Now multiple Training Plan emails are collapsed into a single one, with at-a-     glance information about the different Training Plans managed.

- Not adding team managers by default to Training Plans: Altering a Team's structure (adding or removing Team Managers from a   Team) now results in the expected behaviors of Training Plan not being assigned to the newly added Team Manager, so the       Training Plan correctly stays assigned to the previously Team Manager.

### Bug Fixes:

- Missing BE forms error management
- Learning Path description missing in Content Engine User interface.
- Check validation fields improvement on Content Engine forms
- Fix Discard Changes behaviour for LabSteps.


[comment]: # (The changes for v6.2)
## Release Notes: v6.2 (Feb 19, 2018)

### New Features:

**Improved Courses User Interface**

Our video course user interface got a face lift. There are also several improvements under the hood:

- More granular sync of progress across devices; the user’s position is stored at more frequent intervals so users can continue more easily from another device
- Video preferences can now be saved (subtitles, speed)
- Users can now give feedback to Cloud Academy at the lecture level and report any problems with a specific video

**New Navigation Sidebar Within Learning Path**

We added an expandable navigation bar to all pages within a Learning Path. From within any Course, Hands-on Lab, or Quiz in a Learning Path, users can click the purple ribbon on the left side of the screen and easily navigate without leaving the screen they’re on.
