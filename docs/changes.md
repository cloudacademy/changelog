## Release Notes: v6.2 (Feb 19, 2018)

### New Features:

**Improved Courses User Interface**

Our video course user interface got a face lift. There are also several improvements under the hood:
* More granular sync of progress across devices; the user’s position is stored at more frequent intervals so users can continue more easily from another device
* Video preferences can now be saved (subtitles, speed)
* Users can now give feedback to Cloud Academy at the lecture level and report any problems with a specific video

**New Navigation Sidebar Within Learning Path**

We added an expandable navigation bar to all pages within a Learning Path. From within any Course, Hands-on Lab, or Quiz in a Learning Path, users can click the purple ribbon on the left side of the screen and easily navigate without leaving the screen they’re on.

**Simplified Action Menu on Management Dashboard**

We replaced the small, difficult to click Action buttons on the Management Dashboard with a larger, more easily clickable menu dropdown for Actions.
